Information architecture:

The information on this CV website is organized in a clear, two-column format, and the content is divided into easily accessible sections to increase readability and navigation The left side acts as "profile section" and remains ongoing, with important personal contact information, skills and life stories including press contacts. This option keeps key information (such as name, role, contact information, and skills) visible, no matter where the user navigates on the page. By uncovering skills through the developmental process, the system quickly identifies an individual’s technical skills, making it easier for recruiters to assess skill levels at a moment’s notice

The main content is in the right column and is divided into sections—Topic, Work Experience, Education, and Hobbies. The "About" phase on the pinnacle gives a quick advent, helping customers speedy recognize who the individual is. Then, the "Work Experience" segment is prepared as a timeline, detailing beyond assignments along with dates, job descriptions and key obligations, and lets in viewers to effortlessly tune career progress Similarly additionally the "Education" segment provided heritage statistics on training provided in chronological order. A "Hobbies" section with icons at the bottom offers a personal connect, assisting website visitors in discovering hobbies outside professionalism. This layout promotes clarity and rapid access to vital facts, delivering an intuitive experience for users such as recruiters and functional personnel.





Visual design:

For the visual design of this CV website, I focused on creating a modern, clean, and professional look that enhances readability and user experience. The color palette primarily consists of a bright blue paired with white, chosen for its high contrast and clean appearance. Blue conveys professionalism, reliability, and calmness, which are ideal attributes for a CV, especially in creative or tech-related fields. The use of white as a background color around sections adds clarity, prevents visual clutter, and directs attention to key information.

For layout, I opted for a two-column structure. The left sidebar, containing essential details and contact information, is static and easy to access, while the right column houses more detailed sections that are scrollable. Icons and progress bars add a visual element to sections like Skills and Social Links, breaking up text and making information more engaging. The "Hobbies" section features icons to represent interests, giving a personal touch that rounds out the professional content. Subtle visual elements, like lines and icons, help organize information and improve the overall user experience. This design balances professionalism with a touch of personality, creating a strong visual identity that complements the content effectively.
